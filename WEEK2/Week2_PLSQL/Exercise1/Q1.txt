Scenario 1: The bank wants to apply a discount to loan interest rates for customers above 60 years old.
o	Question: Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a 1% discount to their current loan interest rates.


DECLARE
    CURSOR c_customers IS
        SELECT customer_id, age, loan_interest_rate
        FROM customers
        WHERE age > 60;

    v_customer_id customers.customer_id%TYPE;
    v_current_interest_rate customers.loan_interest_rate%TYPE;
    v_new_interest_rate customers.loan_interest_rate%TYPE;
BEGIN
    FOR r_customer IN c_customers LOOP
        v_customer_id := r_customer.customer_id;
        v_current_interest_rate := r_customer.loan_interest_rate;

        -- Calculate the new interest rate with a 1% discount
        v_new_interest_rate := v_current_interest_rate * 0.99;

        -- Update the interest rate in the database
        UPDATE customers
        SET loan_interest_rate = v_new_interest_rate
        WHERE customer_id = v_customer_id;
    END LOOP;

    COMMIT;
END;
