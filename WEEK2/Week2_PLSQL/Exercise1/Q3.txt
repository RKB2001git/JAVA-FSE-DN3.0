Scenario 3: The bank wants to send reminders to customers whose loans are due within the next 30 days.
o	Question: Write a PL/SQL block that fetches all loans due in the next 30 days and prints a reminder message for each customer.


DECLARE
    CURSOR c_loans IS
        SELECT customer_id, loan_due_date
        FROM loans
        WHERE loan_due_date BETWEEN SYSDATE AND SYSDATE + 30;

    v_customer_id loans.customer_id%TYPE;
    v_due_date loans.loan_due_date%TYPE;
BEGIN
    FOR r_loan IN c_loans LOOP
        v_customer_id := r_loan.customer_id;
        v_due_date := r_loan.loan_due_date;

        -- Print a reminder message for each loan due in the next 30 days
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Reminder: Customer ID ' || v_customer_id || 
                             ' has a loan due on ' || TO_CHAR(v_due_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
    END LOOP;
END;
