Scenario 3: Enforce business rules on deposits and withdrawals.
o	Question: Write a trigger CheckTransactionRules that ensures withdrawals do not exceed the balance and deposits are positive before inserting a record into the Transactions table.


CREATE TRIGGER CheckTransactionRules
BEFORE INSERT ON Transactions
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Check if the transaction is a withdrawal
    IF NEW.TransactionType = 'Withdrawal' THEN
        DECLARE CurrentBalance DECIMAL(10,2);
        -- Assuming there's a function or query to get the current balance
        SET CurrentBalance = (SELECT Balance FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID = NEW.AccountID);
        -- Check if the balance is sufficient
        IF CurrentBalance < NEW.Amount THEN
            SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
            SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Insufficient funds for withdrawal';
        END IF;
    END IF;

    -- Check if the transaction is a deposit
    IF NEW.TransactionType = 'Deposit' THEN
        IF NEW.Amount <= 0 THEN
            SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
            SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Deposit amount must be positive';
        END IF;
    END IF;
END;
