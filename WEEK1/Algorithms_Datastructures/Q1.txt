1. Understanding the Problem
Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in Handling Large Inventories:

Efficiency: With a large inventory, operations like searching, adding, updating, and deleting products need to be efficient. Proper data structures and algorithms ensure these operations are optimized, leading to faster execution times and better performance.
Scalability: As the inventory grows, the chosen data structures must scale efficiently. Inefficient structures can lead to increased memory usage and slower operations, which can affect the overall system performance.
Memory Management: Data structures help in efficiently utilizing memory. Choosing the right structure ensures that memory is used optimally, avoiding wastage or overflow.
Data Integrity: Algorithms help maintain the consistency and integrity of the data, ensuring that operations on the inventory do not lead to data corruption or loss.
Suitable Data Structures for Inventory Management:

ArrayList: Good for maintaining a dynamic list of products where the order matters. However, searching, adding, and deleting can be slow (linear time complexity in the worst case).
HashMap: Ideal for scenarios where quick access, addition, and deletion of products based on a unique identifier (like productId) are required. It offers average constant time complexity for these operations.
LinkedList: Useful if the inventory requires frequent insertions and deletions at the beginning or middle of the list, but searching is less efficient compared to HashMap or ArrayList.
TreeMap: Offers sorted data and provides logarithmic time complexity for basic operations. Suitable if inventory items need to be kept in a sorted order.
