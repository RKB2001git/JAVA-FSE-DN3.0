Arrays are a fundamental data structure with a straightforward memory representation that allows for efficient access and manipulation of elements. Their fixed size and contiguous memory allocation provide advantages in terms of speed and memory efficiency, but they also come with limitations such as lack of dynamic resizing and potential inefficiency in certain operations (like deletion and insertion).

Understanding these aspects of array representation helps in making informed decisions about when to use arrays and how to work with them effectively in various applications.
