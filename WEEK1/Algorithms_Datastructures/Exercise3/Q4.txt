Compare the Performance:

Bubble Sort: Time complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ). It is simple but inefficient for large datasets.
Quick Sort: Average time complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn). It is much more efficient for large datasets compared to Bubble Sort.
Discuss Preferences:

Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort because of its better average-case performance. While Bubble Sort has a time complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ), Quick Sort typically performs faster with an average time complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn). Quick Sort also has better performance characteristics for larger datasets, making it more suitable for practical use cases.
