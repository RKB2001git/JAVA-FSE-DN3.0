Analysis
Compare Time Complexity:

Linear Search:
Time Complexity: O(n)
It checks each element one by one.
Suitable for small datasets.
Binary Search:
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Requires the array to be sorted.
Suitable for large datasets.
Which Algorithm is More Suitable?

Binary Search is generally more suitable for an e-commerce platform, especially if the product data is large and sorted. It is much faster than linear search as the dataset grows.
However, if the data is unsorted or very small, Linear Search might be preferable due to its simplicity and lack of sorting requirement.
