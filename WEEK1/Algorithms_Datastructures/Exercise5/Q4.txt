4. Analysis
Time Complexity
Add: O(n) – Inserting at the end requires traversal.
Search: O(n) – Requires traversal to find the task.
Traverse: O(n) – Requires traversal of the entire list.
Delete: O(n) – Requires traversal to find the node before the target node.
Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically as nodes are added or removed, whereas arrays have a fixed size.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements in a linked list is generally more efficient (O(1) for insertions and deletions if the node is known) compared to arrays, where shifting elements may be needed.
